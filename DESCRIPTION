Description: Implements a general algorithm for estimating Sparse Multiple Index
    (SMI) models for nonparametric forecasting and prediction. Includes
    functions for fitting nonparametric additive models with backward
    elimination, group-wise additive index models, and projection pursuit
    regression models as benchmark comparison methods. Provides tools for
    generating prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty in point forecasts
    produced by the SMI model and benchmark models, using the classical block
    bootstrap method and a new method called conformal bootstrap, which
    integrates block bootstrap with split conformal prediction.
