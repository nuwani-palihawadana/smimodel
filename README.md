The goal of smimodel is to provide functions to estimate nonparametric
multiple index models (which are an extension of nonparametric additive
models) for time series forecasting. The estimation algorithm
simultaneously performs variable selection (hence “sparse”) enabling
parsimonious forecasting models in a high-dimensional context.

## Installation

You can install the the development version of smimodel from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nuwani-palihawadana/smimodel")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(smimodel)
## basic example code
```
