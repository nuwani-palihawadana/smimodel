The R package *smimodel* provides functions to estimate Sparse Multiple
Index (SMI) Models for nonparametric forecasting/prediction. The SMI
Modelling algorithm simultaneously performs optimal predictor selection
(hence “sparse”) and predictor grouping, enabling parsimonious
forecasting/prediction models in a high-dimensional context.

The package also includes functions to fit some benchmark comparison
methods namely nonparametric additive model with backward elimination,
group-wise additive index model and projection pursuit regression. These
functions are designed to have a similar syntax and output format for
convenient usage and interchangeability.

For detailed information regarding the SMI Modelling algorithm refer the
related working paper at
<https://www.monash.edu/business/ebs/research/publications/ebs/2024/wp16-2024.pdf>.

## Installation

You can install the the development version of smimodel from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nuwani-palihawadana/smimodel")
```

## Other Required Software

### Gurobi Solver

The estimation of SMI model is based on an iterative procedure that is
developed using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) to solve an L0 and
L2-regularised nonlinear least squares optimisation problem with linear
constraints. We use the commercial MIP solver
[*Gurobi*](https://www.gurobi.com/) to solve the mixed integer programs,
as it is the fastest and the most powerful MIP solver currently
available. Hence, the users of *smimodel* are required to have an active
installation of Gurobi in their local machines.

#### License

Since Gurobi is a commercial software, the users need to obtain a
[license for
Gurobi](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/12684663118993-How-do-I-obtain-a-Gurobi-license)
before they can install/use it.

Gurobi provides free license for academics affiliated with recognised
educational institutions. Hence, if you are an academic, you can
register for a free account with your verified institutional email, and
then request a [free academic
license](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).
If you are not affiliated with a recognised educational institution, you
might need to purchase a license for long term use. However, you can
obtain a [free 30-day trial by requesting for an evaluation
license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/request-an-evaluation-license/).

#### Installation

Fortunately, Gurobi provides [comprehensive
documentation](https://docs.gurobi.com/current/) regarding installation
as well as usage, and provides active support at the [Gurobi Help
Center](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us).

For step-by-step instructions on software installation and license
activation process, go to [this
link](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/14799677517585-Getting-Started-with-Gurobi-Optimizer).
Note that the procedure for installing Gurobi depends on the operating
system that your using in your local machine. The platform-specific
instructions can be found
[here](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/4534161999889-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-Optimizer).

### R Package “gurobi”

Once Gurobi solver is installed in your local machine, next you need to
install the Gurobi R interface through “gurobi” R package, to use gurobi
within R. This package is not available on CRAN, and is exclusively
distributed with the Gurobi software suite. The instructions on how to
install the gurobi R package are provided
[here](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/14462206790033-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-for-R).

## Example

This is a basic example, which shows you how to estimate a SMI model,
and obtain predictions on a test set:

``` r
library(smimodel)
library(dplyr)
library(ROI)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(tsibble)

# Simulate data
n = 1205
set.seed(123)
sim_data <- tibble(x_lag_000 = runif(n)) %>%
  mutate(
    # Add x_lags
    x_lag = lag_matrix(x_lag_000, 5)) %>%
  unpack(x_lag, names_sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(
    # Response variable
    y1 = (0.9*x_lag_000 + 0.6*x_lag_001 + 0.45*x_lag_003)^3 + rnorm(n, sd = 0.1),
    # Add an index to the data set
    inddd = seq(1, n)) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  select(inddd, y1, starts_with("x_lag")) %>%
  # Make the data set a `tsibble`
  as_tsibble(index = inddd)

# Training set
sim_train <- sim_data[1:1000, ]
# Test set
sim_test <- sim_data[1001:1200, ]

# Index variables
index.vars <- colnames(sim_data)[3:8]
```

``` r
# Estimate SMI model (with "PPR" initialisation)
smimodel_ppr <- model_smimodel(data = sim_train,
                               yvar = "y1",
                               index.vars = index.vars,
                               initialise = "ppr")

# Fitted SMI model
smimodel_ppr$fit[[1]]$best
```

``` r
# Plot estimated smooths
autoplot(object = smimodel_ppr)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r

# Obtain residuals and fitted values
augment(x = smimodel_ppr)
#> # A tibble: 1,000 × 5

```

``` r
# Obtain predictions on the test set
predict(object = smimodel_ppr, newdata = sim_test)$.predict
```
