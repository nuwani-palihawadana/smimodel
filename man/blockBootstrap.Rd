\arguments{
\item{object}{Fitted model object.}

\item{newdata}{Test data set. Must be a data set of class \code{tsibble}.}

\item{resids}{In-sample residuals from the fitted model.}

\item{preds}{Predictions for the test set (i.e. data for the forecast
horizon).}

\item{season.period}{Length of the seasonal period.}

\item{m}{Multiplier. (Block size = \code{season.period * m})}

\item{num.futures}{Number of possible future sample paths to be generated.}

\item{exclude.trunc}{The names of the predictor variables that should not be
truncated for stable predictions as a character string.}

\item{recursive}{Whether to obtain recursive forecasts or not (default -
FALSE).}

\item{recursive_colRange}{If \code{recursive = TRUE}, The range of column
numbers in test data to be filled with forecasts.}
}
\value{
A matrix of simulated future sample paths.
}
\description{
Gerenates possible future sample paths by applying the single season block
bootstrap method.
