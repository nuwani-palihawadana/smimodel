\title{Calculate interval forecast coverage - copied from conformalForecast package
and modified}
\usage{
coverage(object, level = 95, window = NULL, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{cvbb}.}

\item{level}{Target confidence level for prediction intervals.}

\item{window}{If not \code{NULL}, the rolling mean matrix for coverage is
also returned.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical indicating whether \code{NA} values should be stripped
before the rolling mean computation proceeds.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{coverage} with the following components:
\item{mean}{Mean coverage across the validation set.}
\item{ifinn}{A indicator matrix as a multivariate time series, where the \eqn{h}th column
holds the coverage for forecast horizon \eqn{h}. The time index
corresponds to the period for which the forecast is produced.}
\item{rollmean}{If \code{window} is not NULL, a matrix of the rolling means
of interval forecast coverage will be returned.}
}
\description{
Calculate the mean coverage and the ifinn matrix for prediction intervals on
validation set. If \code{window} is not \code{NULL}, a matrix of the rolling
means of interval forecast coverage is also returned.
