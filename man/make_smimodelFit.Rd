\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted \code{gam} object.}

\item{yvar}{Name of the response variable as a character string.}

\item{index.vars}{A character vector of names of the predictor variables for
which are estimated.}

\item{index.ind}{An integer vector that assigns group index for each
predictor in \code{index.vars}.}

\item{index.data}{A \code{tibble} including columns for the constructed indices.}

\item{index.names}{A character vector of names of the constructed indices.}

\item{alpha}{A vector of index coefficients.}

\item{s.vars}{A character vector of names of the predictor variables for
which splines should be fitted individually (rather than considering as a
part of an index considered in \code{index.vars}).}

\item{linear.vars}{A character vector of names of the predictor variables
that are included linearly in the model.}
