\usage{
model_gam(
  data,
  yvar,
  family = gaussian(),
  neighbour = 0,
  s.vars,
  s.basedim = NULL,
  linear.vars = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Training data set on which models will be trained. Must be a data
set of class \code{tsibble}.(Make sure there are no additional date or time
related variables except for the \code{index} of the \code{tsibble}). If
multiple models are fitted, the grouping variable should be the \code{key}
of the \code{tsibble}. If a \code{key} is not specified, a dummy key with
only one level will be created.}

\item{yvar}{Name of the response variable as a character string.}

\item{family}{A description of the error distribution and link function to be
used in the model (see \code{\link{glm}} and \code{\link{family}}).}

\item{neighbour}{If multiple models are fitted: Number of neighbours of each
key (i.e. grouping variable) to be considered in model fitting to handle
smoothing over the key. Should be an \code{integer}. If \code{neighbour =
  x}, \code{x} number of keys before the key of interest and \code{x} number
of keys after the key of interest are grouped together for model fitting.
The default is \code{neighbour = 0} (i.e. no neighbours are considered for
model fitting).}

\item{s.vars}{A \code{character} vector of names of the predictor variables
for which splines should be fitted (i.e. non-linear predictors).}

\item{s.basedim}{Dimension of the bases used to represent the smooth terms
corresponding to \code{s.vars}. (For more information refer
\code{mgcv::s()}.)}

\item{linear.vars}{A \code{character} vector of names of the predictor
variables that should be included linearly into the model (i.e. linear
predictors).}

\item{...}{Other arguments not currently used.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{gamFit}. This is a \code{tibble} with two
columns: \item{key}{The level of the grouping variable (i.e. key of the
training data set).} \item{fit}{Information of the fitted model
corresponding to the \code{key}.} Each row of the column \code{fit} is an
object of class \code{gam}. For details refer \code{mgcv::gamObject}.
}
\description{
A wrapper for \code{mgcv::gam()} enabling multiple GAMs based on a grouping
variable.
