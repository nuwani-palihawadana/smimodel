  data,

  neighbour = 0,

\arguments{
\item{data}{Training data set on which models will be trained. Must be a data
set of class \code{tsibble}.(Make sure there are no additional date or time
related variables except for the \code{index} of the \code{tsibble}).}

\item{yvar}{Name of the response variable as a character string.}

\item{neighbour}{\code{neighbour} argument passed from the outer function.}

\item{family}{A description of the error distribution and link function to be
used in the model (see \code{\link{glm}} and \code{\link{family}}).}

\item{index.vars}{A \code{character} vector of names of the predictor
variables for which indices should be estimated.}

\item{initialise}{The model structure with which the estimation process
should be initialised. The default is "additive", where the initial model
will be a nonparametric additive model. The other options are "linear" -
linear regression model (i.e. a special case single-index model, where the
initial values of the index coefficients are obtained through a linear
regression), and "userInput" - user specifies the initial model structure
(i.e. the number of indices and the placement of index variables among
indices) and the initial index coefficients through \code{index.ind} and
\code{index.coefs} arguments respectively.}

\item{index.ind}{If \code{initialise = "userInput"}: an \code{integer} vector
that assigns group index for each predictor in \code{index.vars}.}

\item{index.coefs}{If \code{initialise = "userInput"}: a \code{numeric}
vector of index coefficients.}

\item{s.vars}{A \code{character} vector of names of the predictor variables
for which splines should be fitted individually (rather than considering as
part of an index).}

\item{linear.vars}{A \code{character} vector of names of the predictor
variables that should be included linearly into the model.}
}
\value{
A list of initial model information. For descriptions of the list
elements see \code{\link{make_smimodelFit}}).
}
\description{
Constructs an object of class \code{smimodelFit} using the information passed
to arguments.
