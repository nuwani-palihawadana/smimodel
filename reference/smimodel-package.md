# smimodel: Sparse Multiple Index (SMI) Models for Nonparametric Forecasting and Prediction

Implements a general algorithm for estimating Sparse Multiple Index
(SMI) models for nonparametric forecasting and prediction. Includes
functions for fitting nonparametric additive models with backward
elimination, group-wise additive index models, and projection pursuit
regression models as benchmark comparison methods. Provides tools for
generating prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty in point
forecasts produced by the SMI model and benchmark models, using either
the classical Block Bootstrap method or a novel Conformal Bootstrap
approach that integrates block bootstrap with split conformal prediction
through an online updating procedure.
